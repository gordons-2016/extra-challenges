Bunny Ears
You have a bunch of bunnies (1, 2, ..., n).
Each even (n = 2, etc) bunny has 3 ears (maybe they have a foot in the air), 
each odd bunny has 2 ears.

Return the number of total ears in a group of bunnies using recursion.
Here are example outputs.

bunny_ears(0) => 0
bunny_ears(1) => 2
bunny_ears(2) => 5
bunny_ears(3) => 7
Write some tests first. Make sure to test for different scenarios. What if you 
get a negative number? How about zero?

If you're having problems conceptualizing the problem, feel free to solve this 
using loops first, but, afterwards, solve it again using recursion.
